## Requirements

| Ref | Requirement                                                                                                                                 | Priority    | Status |

| tbd | Satisfy Prototype requirements.                                                                                                             | Must Have   | To-do  |
| tbd | Have same form and fit as existing unit. This means mount using existing screw holes and supports (e.g. needs same dimensions and cut-holes | Must Have   | To-do  |
| tbd | Use existing power-in                                                                                                                       | Must Have   | To-do  |
| tbd | Support field replacement or servicing                                                                                                      | Should Have | To-do  |

## Design Considerations

### Form Factor

- Single "design" - full custom PCB with ESP32 embedded (complex layout)
- Semi-Modular design - partial custom PCB  with DIP sockets for ESP32 and motor controller (modular layout), likely surface-mounted LEDs and traces for the buttons
